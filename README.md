# TextureToolkit
A few Java functions that manipulate Textures for Gamedev assets
#### NOTE: Right now, these functions only split and combine sprites that all have the **same dimensions** (like icons)

###IMPLEMENTED FUNCTIONS
1. split up a spritesheet into tons of separate icons
2. stitch tons of icons together into one spritesheet + generate XML sheet with names and coordinates
